# Summer Project of Astronomy Club IITK
## Space: The Final Frontier
In this project we study the fundamentals of designing a rocket and launching it in a space mission.
We also learn about Kerbal Space Program(KSP), It is a spaceflight simulation game based on a planet named Kerbin (similar to earth). We design some rocket model and lauched in space and also landed it on Mun (Natural satellite of Kerbin like moon).
