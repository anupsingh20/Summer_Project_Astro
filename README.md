# Summer Project of Astronomy Club IITK
## Space: The Final Frontier
In this project we study the fundamentals of designing a rocket and launching it in a space mission.
We first start with learning the history of rockets including contribution of Von braun and Goddard . Then we learn some rocket equation that are important, we mainly focused in ideal case in which mass and momentum are conserved. Then we learn some non-ideal scenario and also SSTO(Single-Stage-toâ€“Orbit) and DSTO model.

Then we learn about Rocket Design in which we learn about payload, fairing, body, fins. Then comes the aerodynamic part. We learn about shock wave which is a propagating disturbance that moves faster than the local speed of sound in the medium. Types of shock waves are Oblique Shock, Normal Shock, Crossed Shock Waves.

Then we learn about stability of rocket, which is the key to control the whole path of the mission. It is broadly decided by the location of points of Center of gravity (Cg) and center of pressure (Cp). The Cp should always be below Cg to maintain balance.
Then the most important part of the spacecraft mission comes i.e re-entry of spacecraft.
There are two modes of re-entry - Ballistic and Aerodynamic. During re-entry pods move with hyper-sonic speed and this air compression generates heat. So heat-shields are designed to protect the spacecraft from excessive heat generated. Heat-shields uses mainly
two mechanisms: thermal insulation and radiative cooling.

We also learn about Kerbal Space Program(KSP), It is a spaceflight simulation game based on a planet named Kerbin (similar to earth). We design some rocket model and lauched in space and also landed on Mun (Natural satellite of Kerbin like moon).

Then we learn about Engines which include Nozzle, Turbopumps, Combustion Chamber, Plumbing and Aerospike. We also learn some engines like in RS25(Staged Combustion), Raptor (Full flow Staged Combustion).
We then learn about Trajectory Optimization in which we provide the basis for an optimization problem:
Maximize J1 = Payload Mass (metric tons)and  Minimize J2 = Cost ($ ).
We also learn about MOGA( multi-objective genetic algorithm) model for Optimization method.
We also learn some extra things like Communication, Orbital dynamics and Unconventional methods in propulsion.
At last we comes to the result and the Sensitivity analysis.
